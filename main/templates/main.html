            <p>My name is Amadej and I am 18 years old. 👋</p>
            <p>A year ago I started learning Python. I knew HTML, CSS and I did try JavaScript. I decided I would look into Python and have some fun with it. A year later I have this website built with Django and below are some of my small Python projects. 🐍</p>
            <p>I am learning Python in my free time. I am enjoying this very much and there is still a lot more to learn.</p>
