            <div class="box">
                <p>My name is Amadej and I am an 18-year-old from Slovenia. ðŸ‘‹</p>
                <p>Since middle school, I loved reading cybersecurity news about how attackers got in and what the company could do to prevent it.</p>
                <p>In high school we were writing simple websites, although we were the ones teaching the professor... At that time I also got an interest to try out Linux by dual-booting it alongside of Windows, so I could easily switch between Linux and Windows. I switched between a few of the distros and in the process learned a lot about Linux, Unix commands and about different open-source tools.</p>

                <p>A year ago, I started learning Python as an attempt to get into programming, and I love working with it.</p>
                <p>Right now I have a few small Python projects myself and this website is made possible using Python (Django). In my free time I also actively contribute to other open-source Python projects.</p>
