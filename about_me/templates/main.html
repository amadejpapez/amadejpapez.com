            <div class="box">
                <p>My name is Amadej and I am an 18-year-old from Slovenia. 👋</p>
                <p>Since middle school, I loved reading cybersecurity news and just general news about computers. In high school we were writing websites and I got an interest to experiment with Linux at home. I dual-booted it alongside of Windows, so I could easily switch between them. I got to learn about Linux, Unix commands and about different open-source tools.</p>

                <p>A year ago I started learning Python as an attempt to get into programming, and I love working with it ever since.</p>
                <p>Currently I have a few small Python projects myself and this website is made possible using Python (Django). I am also actively contributing to other open-source Python projects.</p>
